3. Project Management Methodologies:
   - Compare and contrast at least two software project management methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban). What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
 Agile Methodology:
Advantages:
Flexibility: Agile is highly flexible and adaptive, allowing for changes to be made throughout the development process in response to evolving requirements or customer feedback.
Iterative Development: Agile emphasizes iterative development cycles, with frequent deliveries of working software increments. This approach enables stakeholders to see tangible progress and provide feedback early in the development process.
Customer Collaboration: Agile promotes close collaboration between development teams and customers, stakeholders, or end-users. This collaboration helps ensure that the final product meets user needs and expectations.
Disadvantages:
Lack of Predictability: Agile's iterative and incremental approach may lead to uncertainties regarding project timelines, scope, and costs, making it challenging to predict project outcomes accurately.
Documentation Overhead: Agile often requires less documentation compared to traditional methodologies like Waterfall. However, insufficient documentation can lead to misunderstandings, lack of clarity, and difficulties in maintaining project knowledge over time.
Resource Intensive: Agile projects require active involvement and collaboration from stakeholders, which can be resource-intensive and may not be feasible in all organizational contexts.

Waterfall Methodology:
Advantages:
Predictability: Waterfall provides a structured and linear approach to software development, with well-defined phases and deliverables. This predictability makes it easier to estimate project timelines, budgets, and resource requirements upfront.
Clear Documentation: Waterfall emphasizes comprehensive documentation at each stage of the project, ensuring clear requirements, design specifications, and project plans. This documentation facilitates communication, reduces ambiguity, and provides a basis for future maintenance and support.
Minimal Customer Involvement: Waterfall projects require minimal customer involvement once requirements are defined, allowing development teams to focus on implementation without frequent changes or interruptions.
Disadvantages:
Limited Flexibility: Waterfall's sequential nature makes it less flexible and adaptable to changes in requirements, technology, or market conditions. Once a phase is completed, it's difficult to go back and make changes without impacting the entire project timeline.
Lack of Customer Feedback: Waterfall projects typically involve minimal customer involvement until the final product is delivered, which can lead to misunderstandings, misalignments, or dissatisfaction with the final product.
Late Detection of Issues: Waterfall projects may not uncover issues or defects until late in the development process, making it challenging and costly to address them. This can result in delays, rework, and increased project risks.
